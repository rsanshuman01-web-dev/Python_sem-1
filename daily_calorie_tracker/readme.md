✅ Project Overview

Many students want a quick and simple way to monitor their daily calorie intake.
This project focuses on building a Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) calorie tracker where users can:

Log meals and calorie values

Calculate total and average calories

Compare intake with daily calorie limit

(Optional) Save the session as a text file for future tracking

This tool helps beginners understand Python basics through a real-world use case.

🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this mini project, learners will:

Use input(), type conversion, and I/O operations

Store user data using lists

Apply arithmetic and comparison operators

Use string formatting and f-strings

Perform file handling using open()

Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking

🧠 Assignment Tasks Summary
Task 1: Setup & Introduction

Create project folder: daily_calorie_tracker/

Create tracker.py

Add comment header (Name, Date, Project Title)

Print welcome message

Task 2: Input & Data Collection

Ask number of meals

Use loop to input meal name & calorie amount

Store values in two lists: meal_names and meal_calories

Task 3: Calorie Calculations

Use sum() to calculate total calories

Compute average calories

Ask user for daily calorie limit

Compare with total calories

Task 4: Warning System

If total calories > daily limit: show warning

Else: show success message

Task 5: Neatly Formatted Output

Print aligned report using:

tabs \t

newlines \n

f-strings

Include:

Meal list

Total calories

Average calories

Task 6 (Bonus): Save Log to File

Ask user if they want to save

Write results to calorie_log.txt

Include timestamp, meal details, totals, and limit status
